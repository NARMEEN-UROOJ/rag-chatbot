Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously.
Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently.

Distributed systems refer to multiple computers working together to solve a problem. These systems
rely on message passing interfaces (MPI) to communicate between nodes.
